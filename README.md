Using NLP to predict cause of death from PHMRC data on verbal autopsies.

## Setup

This section shows you how to setup your codebase and OpenAI key in order to run code in this repository.

Create a .env file at root level (same level as this README) and put in it `OPENAI_KEY=sk-REST_OF_KEY`. Replace `sk-REST_OF_KEY` with your actual OpenAI API key.
