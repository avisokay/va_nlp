"There are two possible labels that could apply to the narrative: 

1. non-communicable 
2. no label applies 

The narrative does not provide any information about the cause of the patient's death, so it cannot be classified as aids-tb, communicable, external, or maternal. However, it does mention a list of diseases and conditions that fall under the category of non-communicable diseases. Therefore, non-communicable is a possible label that could apply. Alternatively, if the lack of information about the cause of death means that no label can be applied, then ""no label applies"" would be the appropriate option."
